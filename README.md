# Predicting-Placement-Campus-Recruitment
## Project Description
Campus recruitment is an Public dataset. 

In this dataset there are total 15 features and 215 data-points.

This dataset contains students data that has education information of each student starting from school to degree completion. 

So we have student educational info like ssc marks, hsc marks, degree percentage, mba percentage etc. 

On this basis we have to find the status whether he will get placed or not through the campus.
 
Here target variable is “status” column.

We clean the data and apply all the algorithms to our model and check which one gives maximum accuracy.
